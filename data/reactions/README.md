  abstract = {Abstract                            Chemical reaction networks, such as those found in metabolism and signalling pathways, enable cells to process information from their environment               1,2               . Current approaches to molecular information processing and computation typically pursue digital computation models and require extensive molecular-level engineering               3               . Despite considerable advances, these approaches have not reached the level of information processing capabilities seen in living systems. Here we report on the discovery and implementation of a chemical reservoir computer based on the formose reaction               4               . We demonstrate how this complex, self-organizing chemical reaction network can perform several nonlinear classification tasks in parallel, predict the dynamics of other complex systems and achieve time-series forecasting. This in chemico information processing system provides proof of principle for the emergent computational capabilities of complex chemical reaction networks, paving the way for a new class of biomimetic information processing systems.},

  abstract = {The rate of frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) using the Grubbs generation II catalyst is impacted by both the concentration and choice of monomers and inhibitors, usually organophosphorus derivatives. Herein we report a data-science-driven workflow to evaluate how these factors impact both the rate of FROMP and how long the formulation of the mixture is stable (pot life). Using this workflow, we built a classification model using a single-node decision tree to determine how a simple phosphine structural descriptor (Vbur‑near) can bin long versus short pot life. Additionally, we applied a nonlinear kernel ridge regression model to predict how the inhibitor and selection/concentration of comonomers impact the FROMP rate. The analysis provides selection criteria for material network structures that span from highly cross-linked thermosets to non-cross-linked thermoplastics as well as degradable and nondegradable materials.},
